As per the problem statement, I have created the whatsapp and hosted on GITHUB. 
As asked to create 4 views, I have merged all in one code.
By default user will see view to chat list and chat area, for viewing new 
message view user need to click on send new message button in top header of chat list
and for profile picture view user need to click on profile picture icon.

I have used JQuery also to bring some aditional features like chat search (by simply writing the freind name),
back and fro click event to go back from one view to another and to upload a typed message.
